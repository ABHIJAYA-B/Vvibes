# vvibes - Blog Website

**vvibes** is a blog website designed to provide a platform where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The website is built using the **MERN stack**, which stands for **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**. These technologies allow us to create a full-stack web application with a highly scalable backend (Node.js/Express), a responsive and interactive frontend (React), and a flexible NoSQL database (MongoDB).

The website uses **Axios** for HTTP requests to communicate between the client and server. Weâ€™ve also configured **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend. **Postman** is used for manual API testing during development, ensuring that API endpoints work as expected. For data storage, **MongoDB** is used to handle both user authentication and blog post management.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vvibes.git
   cd vvibes
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Navigate to the backend folder and install server dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

   - Navigate to the frontend folder and install client dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and configure the following variables:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
   JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT secret key>
   PORT=<Server port, default is 5000>
   ```

4. **Start the Development Servers:**

   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm start
     ```

   The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (for frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (for backend).
